\subsection{Series of Functions}

\ex{1}
\begin{proof}
    Since $\sum g_n$ converges uniformly then the partial sums converge uniformly
    so by the cauchy criterion there exists $N$ s.t. for all $x$
    \begin{align*}
        |g_n(x) + \hdots + g_{m+1}(x)| < \varepsilon
    \end{align*}
    for $n>m\geq N$. Specifically choose $n=m+1$ then 
    \begin{align*}
        |g_n(x)| < \varepsilon
    \end{align*}
    for $n\geq N$. Hence, $g_n \rightarrow 0$ uniformly.
\end{proof}

\ex{2}
\begin{proof}
    Observe
    \begin{align*}
        |f_n(x) + \hdots + f_{m+1}(x)| &\leq  |f_n(x)| + \hdots + |f_{m+1}(x)|  \\
                                    &\leq |M_n| + \hdots + |M_{m+1}|
    \end{align*}
    Since $\sum M_n$ converges absolutely, then there exists $N$ s.t. 
    \begin{align*}
        |M_n| + \hdots + |M_{m+1}| < \varepsilon
    \end{align*} 
    for $n>m\geq N$. This implies
    \begin{align*}
        |f_n(x) + \hdots + f_{m+1}(x)| < \varepsilon
    \end{align*}
    for $n>m\geq N$. Since this is independent of $x$ then the convergence 
    is uniform.
\end{proof}

\ex{3}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item 
    \begin{proof}
        Since $|\cos(2^n x)/2^n|\leq 1/2^n$ and $\sum  1/2^n$
        converges then by the M-test $\sum \cos(2^n x)/2^n$ converges 
        uniformly. Since each term in the series is continuous and 
        uniform convergence preserves continuity then $g$ is also 
        continuous.
    \end{proof}

    \item
    \begin{proof}
        Since $|x^n/n^2|\leq 1/n^2$ on $[-1,1]$ and $\sum  1/n^2$
        converges then by the M-test $\sum x^n/n^2$ converges 
        uniformly on $[-1,1]$ . Since each term in the series is continuous and 
        uniform convergence preserves continuity then $h$ is also 
        continuous on $[-1,1]$.
    \end{proof}
\end{enumerate}

\ex{4}
\begin{proof}
    Since $|h(2^n x)/2^n|\leq 1/2^n$ and $\sum  1/2^n$
    converges then by the M-test $\sum h(2^n x)/2^n$ converges 
    uniformly. Since each term in the series is continuous and 
    uniform convergence preserves continuity then $g$ is also 
    continuous.
\end{proof}

\ex{5}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item 
    \begin{proof}
        Let $f_n(x) = \frac{\sin(kx)}{k^3}$, then $f'_n(x) = \cos(kx)/k^2$.
        Now $|\cos(kx)/k^2|\leq 1/k^2$ and $\sum  1/k^2$
        converges then by the M-test $\sum f_n'(x)$ converges 
        uniformly. Observe,
        \begin{align*}
            \sum \sin(0)/k^3 = 0
        \end{align*}
        So we have found at least one convergent point which implies
        $\sum f_n'(x) \rightarrow f'(x)$. Hence, $f$ is differentiable.
        Furthermore, $f'$ is continuous since $\sum f_n'(x)$ converges 
        uniformly.
    \end{proof}

    \item
    Not easily apparently.
\end{enumerate}

\ex{6}
\begin{proof}
    Fix $x_0$ and study the convergence 
    on the interval $[0,x_0]$ using the M-test.
    Now $x^n \leq x_0^n/n<x_0^n$.
    Now $\sum x_0^n$ is a geometric sequence which 
    converges so $\sum x_0^n$ converges 
    uniformly on $[0,x_0]$. Since $x_0$ was arbitrary then
    the convergence is uniform on $[0,1)$.

    Now each term of the series is continuous so 
    the limiting function $f$ is continuous on $[0,1)$.
\end{proof}

\ex{7}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item 
    \begin{proof}
        Since $|\frac{1}{x^2+n^2}|\leq 1/n^2$ and $\sum  1/n^2$
        converges then by the M-test $\sum \frac{1}{x^2+n^2}$ converges 
        uniformly. Since each term in the series is continuous and 
        uniform convergence preserves continuity then $h$ is also 
        continuous.
    \end{proof}

    \item
    \begin{proof}
        Let $h_n(x) = \frac{1}{x^2+n^2}$, then $h'_n(x) =\frac{-2x}{n^4+x^4+2n^2x^2}$.
        Now $|h'_n(x)|$ peaks at $\pm n/ \sqrt 3$ so $h'_n(x)\leq \frac{3\sqrt 3}{8n^2}$
         and $\sum \frac{3\sqrt 3}{8n^2}$
        converges then by the M-test $\sum g_n'(x)$ converges 
        uniformly. We already know $h_n$ converges on $\mathbb{R}$ from (a)
        so we have found at least one convergent point which implies
        $\sum h_n'(x) \rightarrow h'(x)$. Hence, $h$ is differentiable.
        Furthermore, $h'$ is continuous since $\sum h_n'(x)$ converges 
        uniformly.
    \end{proof}
\end{enumerate}

\ex{8}
\begin{proof}
    Since $|u_n(x)|\leq 1/2^n$ and $\sum  1/2^n$
    converges then by the M-test $\sum u_n(x)$ converges 
    uniformly. Since each term in the series is continuous at irrational points
     and uniform convergence preserves continuity then $h$ is also 
    continuous at irrational points.

    To show $h$ is a monotone function, 
    it is sufficient to show that the partial sums are monotone functions.
    We prove this via induction:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Base case: $s_1(x) = u_1(x)$ which is monotone monotone increasing.
        \item Induction on $n$: $u_n$ is increasing then adding $u_{n+1}$ must 
        also be increasing since for $x<y$, $s_{n+1}(x) = s_{n}(x)+u_{n+1}(x) 
        \leq s_{n}(y)+u_{n+1}(y) = s_{n+1}(y)$
    \end{itemize}
    so $s_n$ is monotone increasing by the induction hypothesis.
    So by the order limit \Thm this implies 
    \begin{gather*}
        \lim_n s_n(x) \leq \lim_n s_n(y) \\
        h(x) \leq h(y)
    \end{gather*}
\end{proof}
