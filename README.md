# Solutions to Understanding Analysis (First Edition)

This repository contains solutions to exercises from the "Understanding Analysis" textbook by Stephen Abbott, first edition. The solutions are formatted in LaTeX to maintain high-quality mathematical typesetting, consistent with the book's style.

## About the Book

"Understanding Analysis" is an introduction to real analysis that aims to bridge the gap between intuitive understanding and rigorous formal construction found in mathematical analysis. This first edition is designed for undergraduate students beginning their journey in advanced mathematics.

## Repository Structure

- **`main.tex`**: The LaTeX source file that compiles into the complete solutions document.
- **`/Chapter_XX_Chapter_name`**: Each chapter has its own folder. Within each folder are solutions to each section.

## How to Use This Repository

To compile the `main.tex` file into a PDF, ensure you have a LaTeX distribution installed (such as TeX Live, MikTeX, or MacTeX). You can compile the LaTeX source file by running the following command in the root directory:

```
pdflatex main.tex
```
